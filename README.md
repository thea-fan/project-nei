# User Experience
1. Problem Statement
  - Neighbours are our most immediate point of contact beyond our own families. However, in this modern world, the interaction among neighbours is much limited. If given more opportunities to interact, the potential friendship and network that can be cultivated will be much beneficial to the community as a whole. 
  - The current solution is either a Whatsapp group or a Facebook group for residents living in the same block or area. However, it is usually the same few individuals who are active in the group and with Facebook, there is also a concern of how much one wants their neighbour to know about their privacy. 
2. User Persona
  - Users who are tech-savvy and willing to socialize with neighbours (age: 6-55)
3. User flow 
  - Browse for events hosted by other neighbours 
  - Host their own event 
  - Check who are the attendees to their interested/hosted events
  - Check the attendance/hosting activity of their neighbours
  - RSVP accordingly
